				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					Hello! </br> I'm Fatima, a passionate and dedicated software developer with a background in Computer
					Engineering from Comsats University Islamabad. During my time at university, I was actively involved in
					the Coding Club, where I collaborated on various projects and honed my skills in software
					development and teamwork.
				</br>
					I have a keen interest in technology and software engineering, with a particular focus on developing
					innovative solutions and improving user experiences. My expertise lies in C, C++ and Python. I have worked on several projects, including PCB designing and robotics, which have
					given me a broad and practical understanding of both hardware and software development.
				</br>
					Currently, I'm doing a Summer SWE Fellowship at Headstarter, where I aim to contribute to impactful
					projects and grow professionally. I am always eager to learn new technologies and stay updated with
					the latest industry trends.
				</br>
					In my free time, I love reading and spending time in nature. These activities provide me with a
					balanced perspective and inspire creativity in my work.
				</br>
					Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of the projects I've worked on and the skills I've
					developed. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, please don't hesitate to get in
					touch!
